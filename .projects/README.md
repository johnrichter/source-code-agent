# Projects

Short-lived, in-repo project workspaces — one directory per project (`.projects/<slug>/`).

- **Tracked in git.** Projects are committed so `delivery-agent-team` (build-with-team) can plan, build, resume, and hand off across sessions.
- **Short-lived.** Complete the work, cut a release (git tag / GitHub artifact / plugin version), consume it downstream, then prune the project directory.
- **Scope.** Everything a project needs (design, plan, notes, scratch) lives under its slug directory — not scattered across the repo root.
